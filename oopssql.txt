OOPS : Object Oriented Programming Systems :  black box testing,
==============================================
1) class : is an collection of data member(variable) and member function (process, methods) with its behavior .....


2) object : instances of an class 
	:to create memory for the class
	:to access whole the properties of an class except private

3) encapsulation : data hiding : wrapping up of data into single unit
	:private your data member and membr function

4) inheritance : properties of parent class derived into child class
	:properties of super class extends into sub class
	:main purpose is : reusablity , extendsiblity
	:there are 5 types of 
	1) single
	2) multilevel
	3) hierarchical
	4) multiple : java does not support
	5) hybrid: java does not support

5) polymorphism  :ability to take one name having different forms 
	:many forms or multiple forms
	there are 2 types
	1) compile time (Method overloading) 
	2) Run time (method overriding)

6) abstraction : data hiding : only essential part should be display and rest of the part will be hide i.e.
==================================================================
SQL :  Structured Query Language: to storing in permenent medium
--------------------------------	 
mysql,oracle, sql server, postgrey sql etc......
	: is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS)
--------------------
Data : collection of information

Database :A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronically storage and manipulation of data.

DBMS (DataBase Management System) : is a collection of programs that enable its users to access databases, manipulate data, report, and represent data. 

RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System): The software used to store, manage, query, and retrieve data stored in a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database.
===========================================================
SQL Commands:
=============
1) DDL : Data Definitaion Lang.
		: create table, create database, use, truncate etc...
2) DML : Data Manipulation Lang
	:insert, update, delete
3) DQL : Data Query Lang.	
		:select
4) DCL/TCL : Data/Trasactional Control Lang
	:commit, rollback, grant , etc..

===============================
Constraints : 
1) primary key : not null + unique : 
2) foreign key : its depends on primary key tables 
3) unique key : all value must be unique not repeating
4) not null : not to be blank
5) check : if you want to check any condition on query time
6) default :value fixed
7) index : if you serach anything but want to do indexing
